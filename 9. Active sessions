-- Question 65
-- Table: Events

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | business_id   | int     |
-- | event_type    | varchar |
-- | occurences    | int     | 
-- +---------------+---------+
-- (business_id, event_type) is the primary key of this table.
-- Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occured at some business for a number of times.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find all active businesses.

-- An active business is a business that has more than one event type with occurences greater than the average occurences of that event type among all businesses.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Events table:
-- +-------------+------------+------------+
-- | business_id | event_type | occurences |
-- +-------------+------------+------------+
-- | 1           | reviews    | 7          |
-- | 3           | reviews    | 3          |
-- | 1           | ads        | 11         |
-- | 2           | ads        | 7          |
-- | 3           | ads        | 6          |
-- | 1           | page views | 3          |
-- | 2           | page views | 12         |
-- +-------------+------------+------------+

-- Result table:
-- +-------------+
-- | business_id |
-- +-------------+
-- | 1           |
-- +-------------+ 
-- Average for 'reviews', 'ads' and 'page views' are (7+3)/2=5, (11+7+6)/3=8, (3+12)/2=7.5 respectively.
-- Business with id 1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8) so it is an active business.

solution : 

with cte as (
select 
event_type, 
avg(occurences) as average
from Events 
group by event_type
), cte2 as (
select 
business_id,
event_type, 
avg(occurences) as average
from Events 
group by business_id, event_type
)
select 
business_id
from 
cte A 
JOIN cte2 B 
on A.event_type = B.event_type
group by business_id 
having 
sum(
  case 
  when b.average  > a.average 
  then 1 else 0 
  end) > 1
order by business_id
